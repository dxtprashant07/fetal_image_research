## Code Organization

The complete training and evaluation pipeline is provided
as a single, well-structured Jupyter notebook.

The notebook is divided into clearly labeled sections covering:
dataset preparation, augmentation, training, evaluation,
and visualization.

Due to computational constraints, full training was not
re-run after final cleanup. Pretrained weights are provided
via Kaggle.
